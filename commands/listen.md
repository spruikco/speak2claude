Start voice listener for hands-free input. Say "Hey Claude" followed by your message.

Run this command in background:
```bash
# The installer will create the correct path for your system
# Windows: ~/.speak2claude/venv/Scripts/python.exe ~/.speak2claude/voice_listener.py
# Mac/Linux: ~/.speak2claude/venv/bin/python ~/.speak2claude/voice_listener.py
```

The listener will continuously listen for "Hey Claude" and type your speech into the terminal.
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
